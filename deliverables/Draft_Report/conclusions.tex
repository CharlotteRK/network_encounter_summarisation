The summarisation tool discussed in this document provides a way to convert multiple formats of collected network data into a single output format. This includes tcpdump network traces and syslog files (as long as some details of the syslog format are given).
If the input data is comprised of a large number of zipped files (such as pcap files segmented by time like those in the dartmouth Dartmouth dataset) the unzipping process can take a significant amount of time. However, this is unavoidable as the files cannot be processes while compressed. A large amount of input data can also lead to the third stage of processing taking a significant time to run, however this is determined by the number of associations and access points in the data and not by the total input size. These time dependencies have been taken into account during the development and have been minimised where possible.\\\\
It is also a concern that the output of the tool is not in a commonly used format and would require newly developed systems for onward processing. Future work on this tool would focus on formatting output so that it could be easily easily input to other systems such as the ONE simulator. The summarisation tool has also been specifically designed to be easy to build on in terms of new input formats; only a small part of the system would need to be re-written for a new input type to be added to the system.
