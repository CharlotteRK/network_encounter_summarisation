There is lots of current research which requires data about the usage of wireless networks, however lots of time and effort must be spent separating out useful information from the huge amount of data now collected by wireless network monitoring. The amount of data sent over wireless networks will only continue growing in years to come. During this project a tool has been developed which enables relevant information for network mobility research to be extracted from multiple input sources and converted to a single, more manageable output. Processing stages in the tools data flow have been separated into individual components to enable easy expansion to new input formats in the future, with the current tool handling only tcpdump and syslog input. The minimum file size reduction seen on real tcpdump traces was found to be 99.992\%. The tool which has been developed has a quadratic dependency of execution time on the number of device-to-device associations in the input data. This dependency could become an issue if very large data sets need to be used with it.
