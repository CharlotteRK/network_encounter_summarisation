%what you could not do
This project has not expected to use face-to-face user testing at any stage and, despite being written to run on the Linux lab machines in the School of Computer Science, all testing and development has been able to be completed remotely using ssh when necessary. No adjustments were made to the development or testing of this project as a direct consequence of the CORVID-19 virus.

A loss of working hours has resulted from the current circumstances due to having to move out of my flat at St Andrews, caring for elderly relatives, and other necessary engagements. However, the two week deadline extension has been sufficient to make up for any work lost during this upheaval.
