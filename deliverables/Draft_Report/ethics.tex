The potential ethical risk associated with this project is low since there will be no contact with participants (such as interviews or questionnaires), and no personally identifiable data is expected to be used. 
Datasets of wireless network activity downloaded from the CRAWDAD archive will be used in this project. The datasets which are to be summarised in this project are sanitised, meaning that details such as IP and MAC addresses have been changed to obscure the identities of the network users. Despite this there is a minor risk that identifying information may be accidentally extracted during the processing of this data.
If any personally identifiable data is extracted it will be removed from any devices which it may have been stored on and the code which caused the mistake will be reviewed to prevent it from happening again. A full ethics application has been made for this project and has been given the approval code CS14642. The ethical application form has been appended to this document in Appendix \ref{section:ethics_append}.
