The usage of the dartmouth/campus CRAWDAD dataset is primarily regarding network mobility, DTNs, and mobile offloading decisions. As such, the most often needed information seems to be node identifiers (for mobile nodes and static access points) and timestamps associated with connections.

There is also research using the dartmouth campus data regarding SDNs and wideband small cell networking. Uses such as these are much less widespread than the mobility studies, however they are still worth considering. They use a wider variety of data from the sets; bandwith, connection quality, MAC address, and transmission rate are all specifically mentioned.

I have summarised what I found from 10 research papers which cited the dartmouth/campus CRAWDAD dataset in terms of their usage of it. To fully make this useful in the context of my project I need to compare it to the fields in the actual datasets, however I am currently having problems accessing them. My notes on the papers are below along with a few words describing the paper topic (full references will be in the write up of this).

[1] Mobile offloading:

	Access point (AP) id
	Time of connection
	Time to transmit data

[2] SDN
	Is AP in sleep mode?
	Number of channels on link
	Channel capacity
	AP capacity
	Gateway capacity
	AP id
	Transmission rate of link

[3] Network selsction
	Number of inbound and outbound bytes/packets/errors
	Users associated with AP
	MAC address
	IP address
	Signal strength/quality

[4] Opportunistic routing
	Mobile node (MN) id
	AP id
	Delivery delay - timestamps?

[5] DTN - N/A as dartmouth set isn't used!
	AP id
	IP address
	Timestamps

[6] DTN
	Bandwidth
	Storage
	(IP? AP id? Timestamps?) - Not explicitly mentioned but I'm not sure how the study could be done without these

[7] WSN - N/A as dartmouth set isn't used!
	TTL

[8] Mobile offloading
	Number of sessions per minute -> would need IP or MN id, timestamp, or possibly a session id; need to look at the dataset to determine what may have been used.

[9] M2M & D2D communication
	User id
	AP id
	Timestamp

[10] Inter-contact time
	Time that devices spend in contact with each other -> assume a user id or MAC address, timestamps, and AP ids
