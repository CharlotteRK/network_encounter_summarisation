Description

With such large quantities of wireless traffic now travelling through networks at ever increasing rates, processing of this data can be challenging. By introducing a summarisation step before any main processing the overall efficiency of information extraction from wireless network datasets may be increased. The aim of this project will be to create a summarised report from large datasets in order to enable more efficient onwards processing of the data. This will mean using statistical approaches to maintain some identified information from the dataset while reducing the overall quantity of data that must be stored and processed. The output summaries created may utilise an existing format if my research can identify an appropriate one. My project will produce a command line application involving new approaches to summarisation to run over data collected in the CRAWDAD archives, the approach taken may (in this project or otherwise, dependent on time constraints) also be extended to work on datasets in real-time so as to eliminate the need for storing large datasets before summarisation.

Objectives
Primary:
- Reduce the quantity of data from the original dataset while maintaining any information identified as useful during research into how CRAWDAD datasets are used.
- Produce summaries of the initial datasets that can be processed more efficiently than the original data.
- Use a commonly found format to output my summaries and justify why this format is appropriate in context.

Secondary
- Allow multiple summaries to be merged (this may allow extension into distributed processing).
- Summarise at least two different formats of input data to create a standard output summary.
- Allow a summary to be updated by the addition of a single data entry (this may allow extension into real-time processing).

Tertiary
- Process datasets with an unknown input format.
- Identify and report if a specific summary is likely to be unrepresentative of the input dataset due to aspects such as missing data or bias. 

Ethics

This project will involve no contact with participants such as interviews or questionnaires. However I will be using datasets containing information that could potentially be used to identify individual devices/users and attribute network activity. The datasets have been sanitised however, and upon registering for access to them I have agreed to make no attempt at extracting personal information from them. In particular, from the data license agreement agreed upon registering with the CRAWDAD website:
"Licensee agrees not to apply, adapt or develop algorithms for the extraction of the true identity of users and other information of a personal nature, which might constitute personally identifiable information or protected health information under any such applicable laws." (CRAWDAD Data License Agreement, https://crawdad.org/registration-form.html, accessed: 22/09/2019)

I will fill out the full ethics application from found on the university website and submit this before using the CRAWDAD datasets.

Resources

The only additional resource that I may need to complete this project is additional storage space on my school user account. This is due to the large datasets that I will be using, some of which reach several hundred gigabytes in size. Aside from this I will not need any additional hardware or software.
