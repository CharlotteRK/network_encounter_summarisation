Activity this week:
- Re-written how the search was performed, read and taken notes on an additional 10 papers
- Aiming to have those ten papers included in the usage table by the meeting

Goals for next week (and reading week?):
- Relate usage research to contents of datasets/ finish usage research
- Finish ethics application
- Begin research of existing formats (aim to produce a table of formats specifying which needs they meet)
- Look into using winpcap/try out simple program

Items to discuss in meeting:
- Ethics form (do I need to email to supervisor before uploading to MMS?)

Points made in meeting:
- Will have most impact and ability to extend by using tcpdump traces initially
- Discussion of what to include in ethics form
