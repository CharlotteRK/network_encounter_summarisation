Progress report for 16-10-19 to 30-10-19:

Activity this week (and ILW):
- Revised ethics application based on comments
- Researched existing formats and written up findings - didn't find many well documented examples (as discussed in write up)
- Looked at the Libpcap documentation and some basic how-tos.

Goals for next week:
- Finish with research into existing formats and revise the write up on it.
- Write a script to parse TCPDump formatted files and extract values relevent to encounters.
- Access crawdad-test host using SSH.

Items to discuss in meeting:
- Ethics form
- I am again unable to download datasets from the CRAWDAD archive
- N^{2} growth in size for any formats in which both encounter endpoints are uniquely identified - I've considered this unacceptable, how important would the missing information be?
- Would adapting an existing format (and adding to it slightly) be an appropriate way to proceed, I've seen quite a few papers talking about the duration of encounters however none of the encounter reports from the ONE simulation include temporal information.  

Points taken from meeting:
- At at point where I should be beginning to build a MVP.
- Rather than downloading datasets through the website I'll use ssh to the mirror host at St Andrews.
