Progress report for 20-10-19 to 27-11-19:

Activity this week:
- Switched from python script to bash for unzipping and inputting data to the program
- Parser seperates out IPv4 packet headers over Ethernet

Goals for next week:
- Test with 802.11 packets
- Develop example output file

Items to discuss in meeting:
- All packets are typed as Ethernet in the files I've looked at, I was expecting 802.11. Am I looking at an unusual set of file or is Ethernet expected?
- Due to deadlines I'm expecting to get less time than usual to spend on this module next week
