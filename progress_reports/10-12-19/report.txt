Progress report for 20-11-19 to 10-12-19:

Activity this week:
- Written an example output file to aim for

Goals for Christmas break:
- Write up design/implementation work so far and continuing over the holidays
- Finish first iteration of working code:
	- C++ code for extracting temporal associations (between devices and APs)
	- Match associations to find encounters
	- Calculate final output information (the number of encounters per pair of 		nodes and the average duration of encounter)
- Begin to consider a format other than tcpdump which could be usefully summarised using the same output. 

Items to discuss in meeting:
- How to find the end of an association between a device and AP, possibly using a timout (if no communication for X seconds assume the device has disconnected/left)?
