Progress report for 10-12-19 to 26-01-20:

Activity over Christmas break:
- Written up draft of implementation work so far (needs more detail added), and skeleton of design section in report
- Working C++ code for extracting associations (between devices and APs, APs identified in this code - not completely acurate yet)
- MatLab matching associations with same AP and overlapping timestamps to find encounters
- MatLab finding the number of encounters per pair of nodes and the average duration of the encounters for each pair
- Briefly looked at dartmouth/campus/syslog files with intention to add this parsing next

Goals for next week:
- More testing with 802.11 link layer packets as I think the issue with identifying APs is more pronounced here
- Allow for run time flags to identify input format (tcpdump or syslog)
- Start ignoring broadcasts
- Write up first draft of design section in report

Items to discuss in meeting:
- LINKTYPE_IEEE802_11 vs LINKTYPE_IEEE802_11_PRISM vs LINKTYPE_IEEE802_11_RADIOTAP etc. are some more commonly used than others for capturing wireless traffic/ which should I allow for, or all?
