Progress report for period 12/03/20 to 02/04/20.

Activity this week:
- Made the changes suggested in the feedback for report sections 1-5, and added further diagrams for section 6.
- Re-running some of the tests with more repeats such that the results may be better presented (some are still running as it's taking a while).
- Written basic code for merging summaries together.
- Can now output a connection trace suitable for use with the ONE simulator. Settings file not generated as there is too much missing info.

Goals for next week:
- Make suggested changes to sections 6-9 of my report.
- Update diagrams and design section to reflect the new config and output formats.
- Update UI report section to include new features.
